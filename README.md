### Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web app that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

### Daily Report
This C# console application collects daily report submissions from students at The Tech Academy. It prompts the user for their name, course details, study hours, and feedback, storing the responses in appropriately typed variables. After collecting the data, the program displays a confirmation message.

### Addition Console App
This C# console application performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input. It multiplies the input by 50, adds 25, divides by 12.5, checks if the number is greater than 50, and calculates the remainder when divided by 7. The code is designed to handle large inputs.

### Anonymous Income
This C# console application compares the annual salaries of two individuals based on their hourly rate and hours worked. It calculates and displays each person's salary and then checks if Person 1 earns more than Person 2.

### Accounting App
This C# console application creates a simple welcome screen for an accounting software. When run, it prints "Welcome to Acme Accounting Systems" followed by "Remember, we’re 'accounting' on you!" to the console. The code is designed to display a friendly message to users launching the software.

### Boolean Logic Submission
This C# console application determines car insurance eligibility based on age, DUI history, and speeding tickets. It checks if the applicant is over 15, has no DUIs, and has 3 or fewer tickets, then prints "Qualified" with a true or false result. 

### Branching Submission
This C# console application calculates a shipping quote based on package weight and dimensions. It checks if the weight is over 50 or if the dimensions total more than 50, displaying an error if either condition is met. If valid, it calculates and displays the shipping cost.

### Number Guessing Game
This C# console application demonstrates boolean comparisons using both a "while" loop and a "do-while" loop in the context of a number guessing game. The program performs a boolean check and continues looping until the condition is met. 

### Functional Strings
This C# console application demonstrates basic string manipulation. It concatenates three strings, converts a string to uppercase, and uses a "StringBuilder" to construct a paragraph of text one sentence at a time. 

### Array Console App
This C# console application demonstrates working with arrays and lists. It prompts the user to select an index from an array of strings and integers, displaying the corresponding value. It also handles invalid index selections and does the same for a list of strings.

### Multi App
This C# console application covers a variety of operations with arrays and lists. It starts by appending user input to each string in an array and displaying the updated strings. The app then demonstrates fixing an infinite loop, using different comparison operators in loops, and searching for items in a list. It also handles searching for unique and duplicate strings, displaying the index of matches or notifying the user if the text isn't found. Finally, a "foreach" loop identifies whether each string in a list is unique or a duplicate. 

### Strings And Integers
This C# console application divides integers from a list by a user-provided divisor. It handles valid numbers, division by zero, and non-numeric input using a "try/catch" block. If an error occurs, the program displays an error message, and after handling the error, it prints a confirmation that the program has continued executing.

### Calling Methods
This C# console application creates a class with three methods, each taking one integer parameter and returning an integer after performing a mathematical operation. The Main program asks the user for a number, calls each method with the user input, and displays the results. The methods perform different operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. The class is placed in a separate ".cs" file for better code organization, and the logic is simple to follow.

### Main Method
This C# console application creates a class with three overloaded methods, each handling different input types: an integer, a decimal, and a string. Each method performs a unique math operation (e.g., addition, multiplication, or modulus) and returns the result as an integer. In the "Main()" method, the program calls each method with appropriate input, displays the results, and demonstrates method overloading and input conversion.

### Method Submission
This C# console application involves creating a class with a method that accepts two integers, with the second one being optional. The method performs a math operation (e.g., addition or subtraction) and returns an integer result. In the "Main()" method, the program prompts the user to enter two numbers, with the option to leave the second number blank. The method is called with either one or two numbers, and the result is displayed. The app handles various input combinations, including scenarios where only one number is entered.

### Method Class
This C# console application creates a class with a void method that takes two integers. The method performs a math operation on the first integer and displays the second integer. In the "Main()" method, the class is instantiated, and the method is called twice: once with positional parameters and once with named parameters.

### Class Submission
This C# console application creates a class with a void method that divides an integer by 2 and outputs the result. In the "Main()" method, the user is prompted to enter a number, and the method is called to display the result (the number divided by two). The class also includes a method with output parameters and an overloaded method for different operations. Finally, the class is declared as static to ensure it can be used without needing to instantiate it.

### Methods And Objects
This C# console application defines two classes: "Person" and "Employee". The "Person" class has two properties, "FirstName" and "LastName", and a "SayName()" method that outputs the full name to the console. The "Employee" class inherits from "Person", adding an "Id" property of type "int". In the "Main()" method, an "Employee" object is instantiated with the first name "Sample" and last name "Student," and the "SayName()" method is called on the "Employee" object, displaying the full name.

### Abstract Class
This C# console app defines an abstract class "Person" with "firstName" and "lastName" properties and an abstract "SayName()" method. The "Employee" class inherits from "Person" and implements "SayName()" to display the full name. In "Main()", an "Employee" object is created with the name "Sample Student," and the "SayName()" method is called. 

### Polymorphism Submission
This C# console application introduces an interface "IQuittable" with a "Quit()" method. The "Employee" class from the previous example implements this interface and provides its own version of the "Quit()" method. In the "Main()" method, polymorphism is used to create an object of type "IQuittable", and the "Quit()" method is called on it, demonstrating how interfaces allow for method calls on objects of various types that implement the interface.

### Operators Submission
This C# console application involves creating an Employee class with Id, FirstName, and LastName properties. The == operator is overloaded in the Employee class to compare two Employee objects based on their Id property, ensuring that comparison operators are overloaded in pairs (i.e., == and !=). In the Program.cs file, two Employee objects are instantiated, their properties are set, and the overloaded == operator is used to compare them. The result of the comparison is displayed on the screen. 

### Parsing Enums
This C# console application creates an enum called DaysOfWeek representing the days of the week. The program prompts the user to enter the current day, then assigns the corresponding value to a variable of the DaysOfWeek type. The assignment is wrapped in a try/catch block to handle any errors (such as invalid input), and if an error occurs, the program prints "Please enter an actual day of the week." to the console.

### Struct Assigment
This C# console application defines a struct called Number, which has a property Amount of type decimal. In the Main() method, an object of type Number is instantiated, and an amount is assigned to the Amount property. The value of this amount is then printed to the console.

### Lambda Submission
This C# console application creates an Employee class with Id, FirstName, and LastName properties. In the Main() method, a list of at least 10 employees is created, with at least two employees named "Joe." A foreach loop is used to create a new list containing only employees with the first name "Joe." Then, the same task is performed using a lambda expression. Additionally, another lambda expression is used to create a list of employees whose Id is greater than 5.

### Input Submission
This C# console application prompts the user to input a number, logs it to a text file, and then reads the file to display its contents back to the user. It demonstrates basic file handling operations, including writing to and reading from a text file.

### Date/Time Submission
This C# console application prints the current date and time to the console, then prompts the user to enter a number. It calculates the time that will be after the number of hours entered by the user and prints that future time to the console. This demonstrates basic date/time manipulation in C#.

### Constructor Submission
This C# console application demonstrates the use of a constant variable and the var keyword for variable declaration. It also shows how to chain two constructors together. The constant variable is assigned a fixed value, while the var keyword is used to let the compiler infer the data type. The constructor chaining allows for the initialization of objects using multiple constructors, showcasing basic object-oriented programming concepts.

### Try/Catch Submission
This C# console application asks the user for their age and calculates the year they were born. It uses a try/catch block to handle exceptions, providing custom error messages if the user enters zero or a negative number for their age. If any other exception occurs, a general error message is displayed. The program ensures that the user input is valid and provides helpful feedback.

### Twenty One Game
TwentyOne Console Game is a C#-based simulation of the classic casino game, Blackjack. With immersive gameplay and interactive responses, this console application mimics the atmosphere of a real casino. Players can test their luck against the dealer, make strategic decisions, and experience the thrill of the game through dynamic, casino-like feedback. Designed for an engaging and realistic experience, this project brings the excitement of Blackjack right to your console screen. I created this application alongside one of the Tech Academy instructors, and learned a lot from it.

### Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web app that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.
