## About This Repository
This repository is a collection of small coding exercises and projects I made using C# and .NET Framework. They were all completed during the C# portion of The Tech Academyâ€™s curriculum.

### Projects:
-[Daily Report](https://github.com/Catherine-Condit/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Daily%20Report/DailyReport)
-[Addition Console App](https://github.com/Catherine-Condit/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/ConsoleApp/ConsoleApp)
- [Car Insurance](https://github.com/Catherine-Condit/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/CarInsurance)

### Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web app that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

### Daily Report
This C# console application collects daily report submissions from students at The Tech Academy. It prompts the user for their name, course details, study hours, and feedback, storing the responses in appropriately typed variables. After collecting the data, the program displays a confirmation message. The code is well-commented for clarity and ease of maintenance.

### Addition Console App
This C# console application performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input. It multiplies the input by 50, adds 25, divides by 12.5, checks if the number is greater than 50, and calculates the remainder when divided by 7. The code is designed to handle large inputs and includes clear comments to explain each step for easier understanding and maintenance by other developers.
