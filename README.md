# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects

## About This Repository
This repository is a collection of coding exercises and projects completed during the C# portion of The Tech Academy’s curriculum. Each folder contains source code and related materials for individual assignments and practice tasks.

As I work through the course, I’ll continue adding and updating projects to reflect what I’m learning. The goal of this repository is to keep track of progress and stay organized throughout the course.
