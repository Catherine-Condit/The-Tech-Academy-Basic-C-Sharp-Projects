## About This Repository
This repository is a collection of small coding exercises and projects I made using C# and .NET Framework. They were all completed during the C# portion of The Tech Academy’s curriculum.

### Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web app that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

### Daily Report
This C# console application collects daily report submissions from students at The Tech Academy. It prompts the user for their name, course details, study hours, and feedback, storing the responses in appropriately typed variables. After collecting the data, the program displays a confirmation message.

### Addition Console App
This C# console application performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input. It multiplies the input by 50, adds 25, divides by 12.5, checks if the number is greater than 50, and calculates the remainder when divided by 7. The code is designed to handle large inputs.

### Anonymous Income
This C# console application compares the annual salaries of two individuals based on their hourly rate and hours worked. It calculates and displays each person's salary and then checks if Person 1 earns more than Person 2.

### Accounting App
This C# console application creates a simple welcome screen for an accounting software. When run, it prints "Welcome to Acme Accounting Systems" followed by "Remember, we’re 'accounting' on you!" to the console. The code is designed to display a friendly message to users launching the software.

### Boolean Logic Submission
This C# console application determines car insurance eligibility based on age, DUI history, and speeding tickets. It checks if the applicant is over 15, has no DUIs, and has 3 or fewer tickets, then prints "Qualified" with a true or false result. 

### Branching Submission
This C# console application calculates a shipping quote based on package weight and dimensions. It checks if the weight is over 50 or if the dimensions total more than 50, displaying an error if either condition is met. If valid, it calculates and displays the shipping cost.

### Number Guessing Game
This C# console application demonstrates boolean comparisons using both a "while" loop and a "do-while" loop in the context of a number guessing game. The program performs a boolean check and continues looping until the condition is met. 

### Functional Strings
This C# console application demonstrates basic string manipulation. It concatenates three strings, converts a string to uppercase, and uses a "StringBuilder" to construct a paragraph of text one sentence at a time. 

### Array Console App
This C# console app demonstrates working with arrays and lists. It prompts the user to select an index from an array of strings and integers, displaying the corresponding value. It also handles invalid index selections and does the same for a list of strings.

### Multi App
This C# console application covers a variety of operations with arrays and lists. It starts by appending user input to each string in an array and displaying the updated strings. The app then demonstrates fixing an infinite loop, using different comparison operators in loops, and searching for items in a list. It also handles searching for unique and duplicate strings, displaying the index of matches or notifying the user if the text isn't found. Finally, a "foreach" loop identifies whether each string in a list is unique or a duplicate.
